# Play Jam 4

Gotta be fast on this one!

The theme is:

> YOUR TIME IS UP!

What kinds of game I can make with this theme?

- A "race against the clock" type of game
  - Something like that Nyan Cat game?
    - It could look something like this:
      - Use the crank to go up and down
      - Press any other button to move to the next part
    - You can get a highscore here
    - You lose if you the walls too often
  - Something like those maze toys?

I think I will go with the Nyan Cat clone. I will start with some
engineering art and then I will think of how I can make this look good.

Tasks:
- [x] ~~Create basic main menu MVC~~
- [x] ~~Create basic game MVC~~
- Let's start by developing the main menu and then implementing some
  actual gameplay
- [x] ~~Populate main menu~~
  - The main menu should contain instructions on how to play the game,
    a warning to tell the user to undock the crank, and the highest score
- [x] ~~Only start game is crank is undocked~~
- [ ] Actually implement the game
- What do I need to implement this game?
- [x] ~~Create player character~~
- [x] ~~Move player character on Y axis depending on crank movement~~
- [ ] Draw barriers
- [ ] Move character through barriers when the player presses a button
- What else needs to be done?
