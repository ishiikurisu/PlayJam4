# Play Jam 4

Gotta be fast on this one!

The theme is:

> YOUR TIME IS UP!

What kinds of game I can make with this theme?

- A "race against the clock" type of game
  - Something like that Nyan Cat game?
    - It could look something like this:
      - Use the crank to go up and down
      - Press any other button to move to the next part
    - You can get a highscore here
    - You lose if you the walls too often
  - Some kind of puzzle game? What kind though?

I think I will go with the Nyan Cat clone. I will start with some
engineering art and then I will think of how I can make this look good.

Tasks:
- [ ] Create basic main menu MVC
- [ ] Create basic game MVC
